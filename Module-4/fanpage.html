            Nipsey Hussle was arguably one of the most, if not the most influental entertainers of the past decade. Before his untimely death, Hussle was heavily invovled in the development of the community he grew up in and planned to develop a low income housing authority self funded. It would offer assistance in childcare, after school programs and career services for adults. 
            His efforts will not be forgotten and the marathon will continue.
